Definition: git status
git-status is a command line tool that interacts with git/github to help you understand the current status of your repository 
compared to the local version. This is particularly important when working with others.
If you were using the Jupyter Lab IDE instead of the terminal, you would be able to look at this via the Git menu and reviewing branches and history.
